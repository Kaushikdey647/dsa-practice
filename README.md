# DSA PRACTICE

![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/Kaushikdey647/dsa-practice?style=social)

My record of everyday DSA practice ðŸ˜„

### The codebase is entirely on c++, however, golang and rust developers are welcome to add in more branches, python and js devs are welcome too ðŸ˜‰

### Why this repo you might ask?
It just adds to my enthusiasm to push some algorithms everyday, atleast one.

### How does it help me?
It got me semi-proficient in DSA since the repo was initialized, which would be barely 2 weeks.

### What after this?

- Add to the code modularity
- Refactor to a proper structure
- Generalize algorithms with comparators or other generic constructs
